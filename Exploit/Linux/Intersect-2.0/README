Background
----------

For an up-to-date feature list, check https://github.com/ohdae/Intersect-2.0/wiki/

Intersect 2.0 is a Python script written to perform automated Post-Exploitation information gathering and reporting.
The general idea is that after you have exploited a target, you run this script and it performs a variety of tasks
that you would normally need to perform manually. Intersect will collect password files, copy SSH keys, enumerate 
processes and installed applications, gather detailed network information, map the hosts internal network (for pivoting),
locate and identify common anti-virus and firewall applications and much more.

The original version of Intersect was a private script and did not have nearly as many features as this version.
One of the big advantages of this version is the capability to find live hosts on the target network and enumerate
services that can be used to pivot access to other systems. Also, I will be adding the ability to transfer the final 
reports and files to a remote system of your choosing. This can be done by using an SFTP transfer or HTTP tunnel.
This version can also scan the system for common anti-virus, firewalls, IDS/IPS and many other applications. 
You will be notified of which applications are installed and where they are located.

This is an ongoing project. You can find a list of upcoming changes and features in the ToDoList file. If you find any
bugs, glitches, errors or any problems with this code please send me an email and let me know so I can fix it.
Thanks for checking out my project and I hope you enjoy it. Check back often for updates!
